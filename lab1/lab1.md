**Q1: What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?**
This is a interesting case study regarding azure defender IOT in geology domain, we are living in interesting times, because during the last decade connecting the computer to the internet was a security risk, and now we are using the security for the servers through the internet. Since, geological companies use lot of IOT devices to extract the data from the available minerals on the earth, if one of there PLC goes down due to ransomware it certainly bring the whole network down, which would be a huge cost for the company, after the IT and OT team came on same page they decide to use the Azure Defender IOT to protect there network and IOT devices.
So forom the company, perspective they are really concerned about the critical IOT and PLCs unit going down due to the security threat.


**Q2: What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?**
Prior to implementing the solution for the Lhoist, it is the best practice to have the proper analysis of the OT and IT infrastructure, from the OT's perspective what are the vendors which are supported for the automation should be documented and analysed so that all vendors which are providing the solution to the company should be supported. 
When it comes to the IT infrastructure, its best practice to analyse the _**network topology**_ apart from the IOT devices, _**human machine interfaces**_ and _**workstations**_, analyzing the _**traffic and bandwidth**_ is also important.
Last but not the least the legacy infrastructure should also be supported.

**Q3: Produce a RACI matrix for the migration stakeholders?**

**Q4: Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company?**
A hybrid cloud migration approach is the most suitable strategy for Lhoist as it allows them to maintain control over their critical OT systems while taking full advantage of cloud-based security, analytics, and scalability. This type of migration approach supports Lhoistâ€™s need to maintain operational continuity, optimizing the security and performance, and adapt to changing business requirements in a flexible and cost-effective way. By leveraging the power of the cloud while retaining critical OT systems on-premises, Lhoist can modernize its infrastructure while mitigating risks associated with digital transformation.

**Q5: Produce a high level schedule for the migration process?**
Planning strategy :
1. Assessing the current IT and OT infrastructure
2. Identifying the workloads for migration (IT vs. OT)
3. Set up a steering committee with IT, OT, and security teams
4. Defining the scope, and success criteria for the migration
   
This high-level schedule ensures that Lhoist can migrate to the cloud in an organized way, reducing the risks while also benefiting from the cloud capabilities like enhanced security, scalability, and operational efficiency. Each phase is carefully planned to include stakeholders, also testing, optimization, and training are necessary for guaranteed smooth transition.


**Q6: What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?**
The Lhoist being a geological company is concerned both on operational efficiency and security, since different teams have different perspectiives so we have to consider the perspectives of all teams.
As far as OT team is concerned they think the operational efficiency is the important outcome, since a detailed monitoring information is available at there disposable so it is easier for them to improve the device performance.
As far as IT team is concerned, they think it is easier for them to implement the network segmentation, also the IT team thinks that it enables them to prevent the security breach.
