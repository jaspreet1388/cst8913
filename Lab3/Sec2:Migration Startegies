Web Application → PaaS or IaaS
Proposed Migration Strategy:
Option 1: Migrate to PaaS (Preferred)
Reason: Web applications typically benefit from the scalability, managed services, and cost-effectiveness of PaaS offerings. PaaS can handle infrastructure management (e.g., server provisioning, load balancing, patching, etc.), allowing developers to focus on application code and user experience.
Cloud Example: Azure App Service etc
Option 2: Migrate to IaaS (For complex, legacy applications)
Reason: If the web application requires more custom configurations, software dependencies, or uses a specific OS that PaaS doesn’t support, IaaS might be the better option. In this case, you'll be managing the infrastructure (VMs) but can still take advantage of cloud benefits.
Cloud Example: Azure Virtual Machines, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
Migration Plan (PaaS Approach):
Assessment: Review current web application architecture and dependencies to ensure compatibility with cloud-native services (e.g., APIs, containerization).
Rehost or Refactor: If the application is built for standard platforms, a rehost approach (Lift and Shift) may be effective. Otherwise, refactor the code to align with cloud-native architecture.
Choose Cloud Service: Choose an appropriate PaaS offering (e.g., Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk) and configure application settings.
Migration:
Set up cloud environment and deploy the application.
Migrate databases, storage, and any other linked resources.
Testing & Validation: Test the application for performance, security, and functionality in the cloud environment.
Optimization: Review and optimize cloud resources (e.g., scaling settings, load balancing).
Cutover: Move traffic to the cloud-hosted application and decommission on-prem infrastructure.
Migration Plan (IaaS Approach):
Assessment: Assess the application for its compatibility with cloud VMs.
Rehost (Lift and Shift): Move the application to VMs without modifying its architecture.
Cloud Environment Setup: Create appropriate virtual machines and network configurations.
Migration:
Install required software on VMs.
Migrate application and configure security settings.
Testing & Validation: Validate that the application works as expected in the cloud VM.
Optimization: Adjust VM sizes, instance types, and network configurations based on usage and load.
Cutover: Move traffic to cloud-hosted application.
2. Database → PaaS or IaaS
Proposed Migration Strategy:
Option 1: Migrate to PaaS (Preferred for Managed Database Services)

Reason: Migrating to PaaS provides a fully managed database service, reducing operational overhead (e.g., backups, patching, scaling). Cloud PaaS databases are often optimized for high availability and disaster recovery.
Cloud Example: Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL.
Option 2: Migrate to IaaS (For Legacy or Complex Databases)

Reason: If there are database customizations or non-standard setups, IaaS may be needed, as it offers more control over the operating system and database configurations.
Cloud Example: Azure Virtual Machines running SQL Server, AWS EC2 with a self-managed database.
Migration Plan (PaaS Approach):
Assessment: Analyze database requirements (e.g., version, scalability needs) and assess cloud PaaS options.
Data Migration Strategy: Choose migration tools like Azure Database Migration Service, AWS Database Migration Service, or Google Database Migration Service.
Pre-migration:
Set up PaaS database (e.g., Azure SQL Database).
Test for compatibility and potential issues (e.g., stored procedures, triggers).
Data Migration: Migrate data from on-premises to cloud database.
Testing & Validation: Ensure data integrity, performance, and that queries run efficiently.
Cutover: Switch production workload to the cloud-based database.
Migration Plan (IaaS Approach):
Assessment: Review database setup and requirements for VM provisioning.
Rehost (Lift and Shift): Move the database to a cloud VM while maintaining its existing configuration.
Cloud VM Setup: Provision appropriate VMs (e.g., SQL Server on Azure VM, Oracle DB on AWS EC2).
Data Migration: Migrate the database files to the new VM.
Testing & Validation: Ensure database performance and validate data.
Cutover: Transition to the cloud database and decommission on-premises DB.
3. File Storage → PaaS or IaaS
Proposed Migration Strategy:
Option 1: Migrate to PaaS (For Shared, Scalable File Storage)

Reason: PaaS storage solutions offer easy access to files across teams and scalable storage.
Cloud Example: Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.
Option 2: Migrate to IaaS (For Legacy File Servers or Complex Storage Configurations)

Reason: If there are complex permissions, file structures, or file access protocols that PaaS doesn’t support, migrating to IaaS with a virtualized file server may be better.
Cloud Example: Azure Files, AWS FSx, Google Cloud Filestore.
Migration Plan (PaaS Approach):
Assessment: Understand the current file storage structure (e.g., file sizes, access patterns).
Choose Cloud Storage: Select the appropriate PaaS storage option (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob).
Data Migration: Use cloud migration tools (e.g., AWS DataSync, Azure Storage Migration Service).
Testing & Validation: Verify data integrity and performance.
Cutover: Migrate production data to the cloud storage and decommission on-prem file systems.
Migration Plan (IaaS Approach):
Assessment: Assess the need for a fully managed or custom file server.
Set Up Cloud VM: Set up virtual machine and storage configurations for file storage.
Data Migration: Transfer data to the cloud VM and configure access.
Testing & Validation: Test file access, permissions, and performance.
Cutover: Migrate to cloud-hosted file server and decommission on-prem file systems.
4. Networking → Cloud-native Networking
Proposed Migration Strategy:
Migrate to Cloud-native Networking: In a cloud-native environment, networking solutions like VPNs, load balancers, and virtual private clouds (VPCs) offer more flexibility, scalability, and security.

Cloud Example: AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, Google Cloud VPC.
Migration Plan:
Assessment: Review the current on-premises network topology and identify key services (e.g., firewalls, routers, VPN connections).
Design Cloud Network: Create a virtual network that mirrors or improves on-prem networking.
Implement Security and Connectivity:
Set up VPN or Direct Connect to link on-prem and cloud networks.
Configure subnets, load balancers, and firewalls.
Testing & Validation: Ensure secure connectivity and validate network performance.
Cutover: Transition networking to cloud and decommission on-prem network infrastructure.
5. Email Service → PaaS, IaaS, or SaaS
Proposed Migration Strategy:
Option 1: Migrate to SaaS (Preferred)

Reason: Migrating email services to SaaS is the most efficient option, providing scalability, reliability, and reduced administrative overhead.
Cloud Example: Microsoft 365 (Exchange Online), Google Workspace.
Option 2: Migrate to PaaS or IaaS (For Custom or Legacy Email Systems)

Reason: If the email service requires specific customizations that SaaS doesn’t provide, moving to IaaS or PaaS may be needed.
Cloud Example: Microsoft Exchange on Azure VMs, self-hosted email systems.
Migration Plan (SaaS Approach):
Assessment: Evaluate current email system setup and users.
Choose SaaS Provider: Select a SaaS email platform (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).
Email Migration: Use migration tools (e.g., Google Workspace Migration Tool, Office 365 Migration).
Testing & Validation: Verify email functionality, address migration issues.
Cutover: Transition to cloud-based email and decommission on-prem email infrastructure.
Migration Plan (IaaS/PaaS Approach):
Assessment: Analyze email system needs for custom configurations.
VM Provisioning: Set up VM or PaaS environment for hosting email service.
Data Migration: Migrate email data to cloud infrastructure.
Testing & Validation: Ensure proper email delivery, access, and performance.
Cutover: Switch to cloud-hosted email system.
Hybrid Approach (Web App PaaS + DB IaaS Example)
Phase 1: Web Application (PaaS) Migration:

Move the web application to a PaaS solution, focusing on scalability and reduced management.
Phase 2: Database (IaaS) Migration:

Migrate the database to IaaS initially for custom configurations or compatibility. Over time, evaluate the possibility of moving the DB to a PaaS solution.
Phase 3: Final Cutover:

Once the application is running smoothly, plan the final cutover from IaaS to PaaS for the database if needed.
